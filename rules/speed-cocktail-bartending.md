## Timing and Preparation

### Rule 29: Preparation Time {#rule-29}
Each competitor will receive at least 1-minute preparation time to organise the bar to their liking.

### Rule 34: Catastrophic Failure Protocol {#rule-34}

### Rule 35: Yielding Time {#rule-35}
A competitor may elect to yield any time in preparation for an attempt through confirmation with the timekeeper.

### Rule 36: Attempt Authorization {#rule-36}
The beginning of each attempt of a competitor must first be confirmed by the event organiser before a valid attempt is made. Any actions outside of this rule will result in a voided attempt.

## Measurement Standards

### Rule 37: Weight-Volume Equivalence {#rule-37}
For the sake of measurement, 1 gram is the equivalent of 1ml for all purposes

### Rule 38: Measurement Precision {#rule-38}
All weights are measured to the nearest 1 gram

### Rule 39: Glass Weight Definition {#rule-39}
The dry weight of a cocktail glass is defined in the cocktail recipe stipulated. A finished drink containing ice will have a dry weight measured with the glass ⅔ full of ice and with a garnish prepared. Once a competitor finishes their attempt and the final drink is measured - it may only then have extra ice added in full.

### Rule 40: Preparation Method Requirements {#rule-40}
Where a cocktail's preparation method (shake, stir, build, roll, dump, etc.) is not explicitly specified in the published recipe, the bartender must use the historically recognised method for that drink (IBA specification or other globally accepted source). Any deviation voids the attempt.

### Rule 41: Ingredient Completeness {#rule-41}
If any ingredients are missing from a cocktail, including garnish, the attempt will be considered void.

### Rule 42: Volume Fraud Prevention {#rule-42}
If the final drink volume in an attempt is measured to be more than twice the recipe suggestion, that competitor is disqualified from the competition. (This is to prevent hacking the competition by pre pouring out the bottles prior to a future attempt.)

### Rule 43: Ice Transfer Rules {#rule-43}
Only ice that leaves the mixing vessel as part of the prescribed preparation method may enter the cocktail vessel. No extra cubes, crushed ice, or ice‑water may be added to the cocktail vessel at any stage. Exception – where the method of the cocktail permits this (e.g., tiki swizzles), competitors may transfer the entire contents of the shaker/tin into the cocktail vessel in a single motion, but no additional ice may be introduced afterwards. Violation of this rule voids the attempt.

### Rule 44: Minimum Pour Requirements {#rule-44}
All ingredients poured in an attempt must be measured out to be at least 80% of the recipe requirement. If any ingredient is measured to be poured less than this threshold, the attempt will be voided. (This is to prevent hacking the competition by absorbing a penalty in preference to time taken pouring out an ingredient.)

### Rule 45: Time Penalty Calculation {#rule-45}
A time penalty will be applied to each attempt at a rate determined by the published cocktail recipe (e.g. 0.15 sec/ml) for every millilitre variance from poured ingredients in addition to variance from dilution volume.

### Rule 46: Attendance Requirements {#rule-46}
A competitor's first timed attempt will need to occur 1-minute after their introduction into the bar - if, for whatever reason, there is no attendance during this time - the competitor will be disqualified.

### Rule 47: Shaker Inspection {#rule-47}
A competitor must not empty the contents of their shaker tin upon completion of the attempt for inspection by an MBC representative.
